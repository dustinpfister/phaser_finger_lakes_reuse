# items lib

This items lib provides classes that can be used to create Items, and Collections of Items. There is a common BaseItem class, that extends from the Phaser Sprite class, and then the Item, and Container class that extend from BaseItem. There is then also an ItemCollection class that extends from the Phaser Group class that is what I am using to create and work with collections of items.

## Current State

As of R7 there is a lot more work to do with this lib, as well as many others, so for now I will not be taking time to write much about this. I will like to add a lot more to the ItemCollection class, and with that, I will also want to change how I am using this class outside of this library as well with respect to the people, and mapdata libs.
