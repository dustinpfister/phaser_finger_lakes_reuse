# ui draft

A main draft making use of the UI lib as I was developing it for the first time.

## Canvas Textures, The Phaser Texture Manager, and the addSpriteSheet method

If the aim is to make a system where Canvas Textures are used to create and update textures for the menu buttons, then I will want to make use of the addSpriteSheet method of the [TextureManager class](https://docs.phaser.io/api-documentation/class/textures-texturemanager).
