# Schedule Today's Color Draft

The goal with this draft is to create a simple app that makes use of the schedule.js lib to create a simple display that shows the current colors of interest. This will be in the form of a color table actually, and will look just like that of the color system draft. The main difference thous is to also show the current date and time, and highlight the current set of color tags. Also dates can be shown for the other lines of color tags in the table while we are at it.
