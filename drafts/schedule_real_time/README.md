# Schedule Real Time Draft

The reason for this demo is to make sure that real time mode works for the GameTime class of the schedule lib. As the name inplies real time means that the passage of game time, is just simply in sync with real world time. So the current game time is the same as the time of the client system on which the game runs, and the rate at which time passes is the same as well.
