# People Draft

This is the main draft project that makes use of the current state of the people.js lib of the game. This draft should be updated when making major changes to the library to make sure that things are working just fine with respect to just the people lib alone. 

## Custom AI Scripts for People Types

One thing that comes to mind if I am to bother with a little side project such as this is to make sure that I can start over with a clean slate when it comes to making a whole new AI for a given 'People Type'. So this draft should make use of a custom collection of actions and tasks in place of what is used in the main game project here.
