# map_system_chunks draft

The goal here is to have a new map system where a single map is updated from many 'map chunks'. So then at any moment a single map is updated with as much as 9 chunks rather than one large map. This way things can only be updated for each current active chunk rather than one large map, allowing for much larger maps that what would otherwise be possible.
