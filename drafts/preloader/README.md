# preloader  draft

I do have some concern for people who might visit a page that is hosting the game using a computer that is connected to the internet with a very slow internet collection. Phaser alone takes up about 800kb of data, add on top of this all the other assets that must be loaded in other to start a load state, it might take a long time for them to even get to the point where they start to see a loading screen. So this project aims to be a simple 'preloader' of sorts that will show the current progress of the core assets that need to be loaded in order to even start loading.
