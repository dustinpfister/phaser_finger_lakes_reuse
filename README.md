# Phaser Finger Lakes Reuse

This is a game where I am simulating how to work a job at finger lakes reuse mega center in Ithaca New York. The goal here is to make a game that is fun to play, but also practical in the sense that it can be used as a way to help train new employees, volunteers, and people returning to work via the apprentice program.
