# Phaser Finger Lakes Reuse

This is a game where I am simulating how to work a job at [finger lakes reuse mega center in Ithaca New York](https://ithacareuse.org/). The goal here is to make a game that is fun to play, but also practical in the sense that it can be used as a way to help train new [employees](https://ithacareuse.org/staff/), [volunteers](https://ithacareuse.org/volunteer/), and people returning to work via the [reset apprentice program](https://ithacareuse.org/reset/). At the time of this writing the game is still very much in a kind of [alpha state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle), however I do intend to keep working on this until I have something that is worthy of being published.

## Workers

The player takes control of a Worker and can use to prefrom tasks such sorting items in Donation Intake \( DI for short \). It is also possible to switch between workers so the player can switch from controling a woker in DI to another worker prefroming some other Task such.

## Customers

There are two major types of Customers, shopers, and donators. The names shouls speak for themselfs, but yes donators will drop of items that are to be sorted and priced. Shopers will buy an item that has been priced.
