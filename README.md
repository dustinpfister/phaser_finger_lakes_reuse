# Phaser Finger Lakes Reuse

This is a game where I am simulating how to work a job at [finger lakes reuse mega center in Ithaca New York](https://ithacareuse.org/). The goal here is to make a game that is fun to play, but also practical in the sense that it can be used as a way to help train new [employees](https://ithacareuse.org/staff/), [volunteers](https://ithacareuse.org/volunteer/), and people returning to work via the [reset apprentice program](https://ithacareuse.org/reset/). At the time of this writing the game is still very much in a kind of [alpha state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle), however I do intend to keep working on this until I have something that is worthy of being published.
